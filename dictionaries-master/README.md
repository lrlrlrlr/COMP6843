### Dictionaries

This repository contains custom made dictionariy used to directories/files enumeration when attacking web applications.

### Starter dictionary
contains
`starter.txt` most common entries one can found on any web server. Configuration files, IDE files, dot files, default CMS, CRM, eCommerce engines, backups, "hidden" panels, admin interfaces, SQLs - name it.

I've named it `starter`, because I use this dictionary as very first when doing files/folders enumeration on the webserver.
